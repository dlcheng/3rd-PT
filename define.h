The one-loop power spectra of the density, velocity, and their cross are calculated 
in the Einstein-De siter Universe. 
Unit:
                         1 length = 1 Mpc/h
                         1 velocity = 100 km/s
                         da / d tau = sqrt(a), where dtau = dt /a with the interal velocity and length units.
